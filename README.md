Firstly, before using "project1.html" Please save "bootstrap.css" in the same folder as of "project.html" as we have linked "project.html" with "bootstrap.css" to,somewhat,change the layout of the page.

After Opening project.html in your browser a google map will be generated with some options at the left. These options are for getting the corresponding trails on the google map with some details.

Steps:

1) Select Ukhra(as we have only worked on Ukhra as of now).

2) Select the time zone: Early Morning/Busy Hours/ Both .

Selecting a choice here filters the trails accordingly.

NOTE: If you do not select anything here, program will be terminated after showing an error.

3) Write your preferred Velocity Range.

This will filter the trails according to your velocity and will show the mentioned velocity edges with Thick Pink line.

NOTE: If you do not write anything in the Velocity box, then no filtering will be done and trails with all the velocities will be shown.

4) Select Vertex/Edge/Both .

i) If you select "Vertex", then only vertices will be shown.
ii) If you select "Edge" or "Both", then both edges and vertices will be shown.

NOTE: If you do not select anything here, program will be terminated after showing an error.

5) Choose the Vertex Colour. 

If you do not chose any colour, Red coloured vertices will be shown.

6) Choose the Edge Colour.

If you do not chose any colour, Blue Coloured Edges will be shown.

NOTE: All the edges corresponding to the mentioned Velocity will be shown by thick pink lines.
	  Remaining Edges will be shown by thin and above chosen colour.

7) Click on OK button to upload the file "data.txt"(containing all the trails). As you upload the file all the trails after getting filtered according to your options chosen will be shown on the map. 


NOTE: 1) Clicking on any vertex opens a sidebar window showing all the details about the particular bus stop.
	  2) Clicking on any edge opens a sidebar window showing all the details about the particular edge between two bus stops.
